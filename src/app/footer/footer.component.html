            <p>The AudioDeadline website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

When you return to the same AudioDeadline website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the AudioDeadline features that you customized.
              <br/><br/>
